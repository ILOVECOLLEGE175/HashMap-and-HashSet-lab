TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

24. A hash map is used mainly for storage or a way to get easy access to important files.
To use it you must import the hashmap class. then you must create your values like 1 & 2. you can then use the hash map to retrieve the value.

25. yes you can use the same type of parameter for two different things and the hashmap can sort them out.

26. you must input the code int numberOfEnteries = map.size(); 
      System.out.println("number in entries in the map = " + numberOfEnteries);

28. It does not create a new entry, it just updates the value linked to the old key.

29. 2 new entry's are created with their own unique key and the map size increases.

30. you would need to input String keytoCheck = the value or name of the integer and have a output like 
if (mymap.containskey(keytoCheck)) {
    System.out,println("the key is" + keytoCheck);
}

31. The map would return nothing since there is no input that matches its expectations.

32. you would have to set up a get method and have it get the keys in all the maps


33.
